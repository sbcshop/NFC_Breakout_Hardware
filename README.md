The NFC module is an excellent solution for enthusiasts, makers, and developers who want to harness the power of NFC technology, whether it's for prototyping or building advanced applications, the NFC module delivers the functionality, reliability, and flexibility needed for a wide range of projects.
The term "NFC" refers to a short-range, high-frequency wireless communication technology that is mostly used in mobile or portable devices. It enables radio connection to be established by just touching two phones together or keeping them a few millimeters apart. Holding two devices together and using a wireless communication link for the final few centimeters makes choosing a target straightforward. Induction-coupling, which uses magnetic induction between two loop antennas operating at a frequency of 13.56MHZ with data rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s, is the primary communication method used in NFC. 

This Github provides instructions to get started with the NFC module.
